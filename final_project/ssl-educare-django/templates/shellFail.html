The autograder âš™ failed to parse the output of the script ðŸ“ƒ you submitted
 for grading Assignment {{number}}. The autograder used {{graderUsed}} to
 run your script. The output from the process is given below:<br>
 <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
    <pre>
    {{output}}
    </pre>
</p>
<h4>Guidelines for writing shell scripts for the autograder:</h4>
<ol>
<li> The program will be run from a directory that contains the submissions
sorted into folders for each student, named by their roll number. Your
directory operations should be written with this in mind.<br>
Example: The directory with your script looks like:<br>
<pre>
script.sh
200050001/mysubmission.exe
200050002/mysubmission.txt
...</pre>
<br>

</li>
<li>
    The program should print nothing but the json-serialized output
    of a dictionary whose keys are your students' userids, and values
    are dictionaries, each with a key-value pair for 'grade' and 'feedback.'
    Your program can update this dictionary as it checks the submissions.
    Example:<br>
    <pre>
    grades = {
        "200050001":{
            "grade":1,
            "feedback":"Good job!"
        },
        "200050002":{
            "grade":0,
            "feedback":"Why can't you be more like 001?"
        }
    }
    </pre>
</li>
<li>
    As a standard coding practice, your script should be as error-safe as possible. Any function
    that can cause the script to crash should be enclosed in try-except blocks
</li>
</ol>
